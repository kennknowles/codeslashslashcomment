Code Slash Slash Comment
========================

These are articles from the blog at http://codeslashslashcomment.com 

They are explorations / self-teaching sessions of the author in various
libraries and techniques, generally in Scala.

The articles are mostly heavily commented Scala, with accomanying
text files containing the final draft of the text on the blog.
The code is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License so you should be able to use
it in whatever way you like. I ask that the actual text of the article not be
reproduced in an expository context except to quote it or cite it. Be nice :-)
